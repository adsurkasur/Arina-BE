# Arina-BE Backend

## Development

- Run `npm run dev` for hot-reloading development (ts-node-dev)
- Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript to `dist/`
- Run `npm start` to start the production server from `dist/`

## Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your environment variables.

## Notes
- Vite is not used for backend. Frontend is handled separately.
